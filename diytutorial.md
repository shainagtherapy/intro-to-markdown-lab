**Purpose**: This simple exercise practices awareness and brings us into presence during moments of overwhelm and distraction. Run yourself through these steps when you need to feel grounded, and need to refocus!

```
This exercise is meant to easily fit into any moment of the day such as:

* brewing coffee
* sitting at your desk
* while driving
* on a walk
* grocery shopping
```
Take a moment to re-adjust your posture and inhale a slow breath through the nose.

1. Begin by noticing ***five things*** *that you can see around you*.
Take the time you need to let your vision zoom out and scan your surroundings.

2. Identify ***four things*** *you can physically feel*.
An easy pattern is to scan your body to notice sensations from head to toe.
Examples:
* Feel the hairs on your head.
* The fabric of your clothes against your skin.
* Tuning in to your heartbeat.
* Wiggle your toes and feel what your feet are in, or the surface they are on.

3. Listen for ***three sounds*** *you can hear*.
Take a deep breath through the nose, with the mouth closed to represent this moment of listening.
Perhaps you can enhance your environment by **adding pleaseant background music**, or closing a window to quiet your immediate space.

4. Notice ***two things*** *you can smell*.
If you don't notice anything in your immediate space, take a moment to change rooms or move around until you do.

5. ***Remember something you tasted today***.
We don't often stop and savor taste- allow yourself a moment of appreciation for something you tasted today as a simple way of expressing **gratitude** and grounding.

End with another slow breath through the nose, and continue on with your day. You can repeat the exercise as often as you want to.

**Keep it simple, no need to overthink what we notice!**
```
This exercise can be expanded by creating an intentional meditation, journaling your answers, and gathering things that will help you notice your senses such as aromatherapy, favorite fabric textures to wear, and supportive background sounds for a positive mood.
